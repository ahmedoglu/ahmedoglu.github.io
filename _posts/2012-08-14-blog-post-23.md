The 2025 Bundestag election results paint two very different pictures when it comes to forming a government: one without FDP and BSW, and the other with them in the mix. 

If FDP and BSW are left out, the Union (CDU/CSU) + AfD coalition would hold 355 seats, giving them a clear majority, but let's be real—that’s not a politically viable option given the current landscape. 

The most realistic coalition here is Union + SPD with 328 seats, which secures a majority and follows past government patterns. However, negotiating between these two parties is never easy, given their ideological differences. Meanwhile, a Union + Greens coalition (304 seats) wouldn’t even hit the majority mark, meaning they’d need outside support. With such limited options, the Union has all the leverage, forcing SPD and the Greens to give up more ground in negotiations. 

From a game theory perspective, coalition stability depends on whether parties have strong backup plans—and without FDP and BSW, those alternatives shrink, putting more power in the hands of the bigger parties.

Now, if FDP and BSW do come into play, everything shifts. The Union + SPD coalition suddenly falls short (293 seats), so they either have to bring in the Greens (for a massive 378-seat majority) or FDP (for a 326-seat majority). This changes the entire dynamic, giving smaller parties like FDP and the Greens way more bargaining power—because now, they’re essential. 

Union + SPD + FDP (326 seats) is a more balanced and practical coalition, whereas Union + SPD + Greens (378 seats) would be super stable but way harder to manage ideologically. According to negotiation strategy, whenever new players enter the mix, power gets redistributed, which makes coalitions more flexible but also trickier to hold together.

At the core of all this is who holds the upper hand at the negotiation table. Without FDP and BSW, Union is in control—they set the terms, and SPD or the Greens just have to go along with it. With FDP and BSW in the game, though, Union loses some of its dominance, and suddenly, FDP, the Greens, and BSW become kingmakers. 

Game theory tells us that more options mean more competition—which, in politics, translates to tougher, messier negotiations. Union + SPD + FDP (326 seats) feels like the most practical choice, offering a solid majority without unnecessary chaos. But if negotiations hit a wall, Union + SPD + Greens (378 seats) would be the safest bet—which just goes to show how much FDP and BSW’s inclusion shakes up the entire government formation process.
