This research investigates the potential of repurposing military drones in civilian applications and uses the Bayraktar TB2 as a case study. The key differences between military and civilian drone uses are identified through a comparative framework that emphasizes the need for deep investigation from different perspectives to identify the factors that influence the technology transfer in this case. The research includes a cost-benefit analysis (CBA), which reveals significant market potential and economic advantages. It's important to mention that the data used in the analysis are from public data, which means they are not precise numbers but give close-to-reality results. The results suggest that government policies, industry partnerships, and public engagement are important for the successful technology transfer of military drones. The Bayraktar TB2, which was originally built for surveillance and combat, shows potential in civilian applications, including agriculture, logistics, and public safety, despite the challenges, including regulations, conversion costs, and privacy concerns associated with such a technology transfer. This study provides practical guidance for integrating military drones into civilian sectors and helps understand the potential of dual-use technologies.
