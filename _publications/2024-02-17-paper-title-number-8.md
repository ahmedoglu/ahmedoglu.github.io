Security in Europe is not just about technology—it is about the narratives that shape how societies perceive and manage threats. These security sociotechnical imaginaries—shared visions of how technology can maintain order and mitigate risks—are largely constructed by the European Union’s core member states. However, peripheral European states, with distinct historical experiences, geopolitical concerns, and resource constraints, often find themselves negotiating, adapting, or resisting these dominant security frameworks.  

This paper examines how security imaginaries evolve at the intersection of EU-wide policies and the localized realities of peripheral states. While the EU promotes a vision of integrated security based on interoperable surveillance systems, predictive policing, and AI-driven risk assessment, peripheral states face a different set of challenges. Their security concerns are shaped by post-Soviet transitions, hybrid warfare threats, and economic constraints that often make full adherence to EU security models impractical or even undesirable.  

By analyzing how security technologies—such as border surveillance, cybersecurity infrastructures, and AI-based risk prediction—are implemented and contested across different regions, this paper highlights the fundamental tensions between centralized EU security paradigms and the diverse realities of its member states. Case studies, including Estonia’s "digital fortress" model, illustrate how peripheral nations both engage with and push back against dominant EU security imaginaries. A quadrant assessment framework is introduced to categorize these divergent approaches, emphasizing differences in technological adaptation, risk perception, and governance priorities.  

Ultimately, this study argues that security in Europe is not merely a technical or logistical issue but a deeply political and societal. As peripheral states assert their own security needs and priorities, the EU must reconsider its top-down approach to security governance. This paper contributes to sociotechnical imaginary theory by demonstrating how peripheral states actively shape, contest, and redefine European security landscapes rather than merely adopting externally imposed frameworks. Policy recommendations include increasing subsidiarity in security funding, establishing regional foresight observatories, and fostering technology sovereignty initiatives that empower peripheral states to develop security strategies suited to their unique contexts.
