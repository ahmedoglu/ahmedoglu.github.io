This analysis is based on triggered research by Uğur Ermiş and Günseli Gümüşel, published in Defense & Security Analysis (2023, Volume 39, Issue 1), for a critical appreciation of the industry’s failures and challenges between 1919 and 1950 in Turkey. It provides an effort toward baselining the understanding of the historical context that provides a backdrop for evaluating the industry’s evolution. Moreover, this analysis makes detailed comparisons with the current state of the Turkish defense sector based on recent data and my research findings. In this way, it incorporates historical perspectives with up-to-date information to build a complete picture of how the industry of that country has changed from early misguided beginnings into the successes it experiences at the current time.

Historical Context (1919–1950)
======
Foundation and Early Development
------
At the end of the First World War and most significantly with the founding of the Republic of Turkey, the new state faced the colossal duty of creating an autonomous defense industry. The first measures aimed to set up various factories for weapon and ammunition production and aircraft construction. The early attempts at aircraft design by pioneers like Vecihi Hürkuş and the private initiatives of TOMTAŞ were shaken by high financial instability and bureaucratic problems. Despite these challenges, the Turkish defense industry showed remarkable resilience, paving the way for future development. At the dawn of the 20th century, the Turkish defense industry was ailing with an underdeveloped industrial base and technological capabilities. Sufficient infrastructure, such as the ability to produce and develop defense materials, had not been developed in the country. Bureaucratic inefficiencies and the problems arising from many rules and regulations mostly stood in the way of streamlining operations and achieving growth. Further complicating the matter were the external factors — made possible by US aid’s role in the Truman Doctrine during World War II. Though considered imperative, such aid led to dependency, breeding economic pressure and leaving Turkey little room for a fully independent defense industry.

Acute Economic Constraints
------
The early Turkish defense industry was heavily based upon imported technology and equipment. Domestic production was scant to meet the country’s defense needs or compete internationally. Financial difficulties were widespread, with high maintenance costs and limited production capability, causing economic pressure within the sector. This heavy reliance on imports and trying to formulate a self-sufficient industry created significant growth barriers and stability problems throughout this period.

Current Status (2024) Modern Developments
======
Turkey’s defense industry is developing today at an impressive rate and modernization. It has transformed into a robust and competent industry that has advanced significantly in aerospace, naval, and land systems. Turkish Aerospace Industries, ASELSAN, and Roketsan have become the top companies in the field, enabling Turkey to achieve complete self-sufficiency in manufacturing modern aircraft, tanks, and drones. This marks a profound turning point away from the initial dependence on foreign technology and reflects the continuous developments in creating a solid, capable, and self-reliant defense capability.

Technological and Industrial Development
------
New Turkey is heavily invested in strategic technological developments that have transformed its defense industry. Great importance is given to indigenous development, and modern derivations of combat aircraft, such as the TAI TF-X, ultramodern drones like the Bayraktar TB2, and advanced missile systems, are radiating out of Turkey. Now, the country has a mature industrial infrastructure with state-of-the-art facilities and research centers that can evolve more incredible innovation and improvement. This progress is a quantum leap from the technological and industry gaps that characterized the early years of the defense sector.

Strategic and Economic Factors
------
At the strategic level, Turkey has not only developed a strong defense industry but also strong international partnerships. These alliances strengthen Turkey’s position as a credible defense product exporter, which adds importance to its trade balance and geopolitical heft. The defense sector’s considerable contribution to the Turkish economy is a testament to the country’s strategic potential and its ability to stand on its own in the global defense market.

Bureaucratic and Strategic Planning
------
What has hence majorly facilitated the growth of this industry is modernization in the country’s bureaucracy and, therefore, strategic planning. At the center of this whole management and coordination system is the Presidency of Defense Industries, the SSB. A national defense strategy focuses on indigenization, technological enhancement, and strategic autonomy. All these features contrast sharply with the bureaucratic inefficiencies of the past.

Economic Impacts
------
The Turkish defense industry has seen substantial economic growth in recent years. As of 2024, the industry has attracted over $10 billion in investments. This substantial influx of capital has significantly boosted the sector’s capabilities and infrastructure.

Additionally, the defense industry has created over 75,000 jobs, contributing greatly to the Turkish economy. These roles span various sectors, including manufacturing, research and development, and support services, underscoring the industry’s impact on employment and economic development.

As Turkey focuses on reducing its import dependency and enhancing domestic production capabilities, its defense sector has become a prominent player in the global market. This remarkable transition from an import-dependent industry to a self-reliant and competitive sector highlights Turkey’s strategic vision and successful implementation of advanced technologies and manufacturing processes.

Comparative Summary
======
The story of Turkey’s defense industry evolution from its early days until now is one from dependency and instability to sophistication and self-sufficiency. The massive technological and industry strides portray a strong and resilient defense sector currently playing a pivotal role in Turkey’s economy and strategic landscape. This is supported by improvements in bureaucratic efficiency, strategic planning within the sector, and others that underpin this progress — in stark contrast to developments from the challenges of the early 20th century to advanced capabilities today.
