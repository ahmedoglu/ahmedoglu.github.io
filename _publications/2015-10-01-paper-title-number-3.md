The national defense strategy evolves within the intersection between innovation, societal values, and public policy. In this paper, a comparative analysis of Turkish and German defense policies is conducted to examine how each countryâ€™s unique societal values, geological stance and historical backdrop have influenced their respective approaches to innovation, defense, and policymaking. Turkey and Germany were chosen for this comparative study because of their divergent historical experiences with society formulation, security challenges, conflicts, and alliance formations, as well as their distinct positions in the global and regional geopolitics landscape. Throughout this paper, the study seeks to illuminate the different ways in which innovation (specifically in defense), driven by both strategic foresight and necessity, interacts with public policy and societal values to shape the national defense strategy. This comparative analysis goes beyond theoretical study; it also has practical implications for decision makers in defense and members of society.
