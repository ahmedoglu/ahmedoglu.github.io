I am Mümin Ahmedoğlu, studying for my Master's in **Management and Technology** at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). My academic interest lies at the junction of **Strategy, Policy, Management, and Innovation**, with a technological specialization in **Computer Engineering**. On that note, my studies have equipped me with a robust understanding of the **politics of innovation**, current issues related to **technology management**, and **public policy**.

My key areas of research interest lie at the intersection of **defense innovation**, **arms control**, **disarmament**, and how they relate more broadly to **global security and technology policy**. In particular, I focus on how changes in technologies influence the dynamics of **international security and policy development**. Finally, I am also interested in the **economic and political factors** that drive **innovation** in the **defense sector**, the role of the industrial base and technological infrastructure in fostering innovation, and how innovation links back into defense exports.

My current research projects include an **empirical comparative study** of the **defense policies** of Turkey and Germany, **re-purposing** **military UAVs for civilian uses**, and the global dynamics of defense spending. These projects use advanced regression models and impulse response functions applied to multi-country data to further advance the present understanding of defense innovation's economic, political, and technological drivers.

I mastered **Arabic**, **English**, and **Turkish**, and I am currently learning **German**, which helps me to enhance my ability to **collaborate** internationally. My goal is to be able soon to contribute to defense and security with cutting-edge research and, therefore, share it with the broader academic and policy-making communities.

Feel free to explore my work and reach out for possible collaborations or discussions on topics related to defense innovation and technology management.

Research Interests
======
My research interests encompass a broad range of topics within the fields of innovation in defense, arms control, and disarmament, including:

- **Defense Innovation:** Investigating how technological advancements such as UAVs, AI, and cyber warfare reshape military capabilities and influence global security policies.

- **Arms Control:** Examining international treaties, policies, and mechanisms designed to regulate the proliferation and development of conventional and unconventional weapons, including nuclear, biological, chemical, and traditional arms, to enhance global security and stability.

- **Disarmament:** Exploring strategies and frameworks for the systematic reduction and abolition of armed forces and weapons, aiming to create conditions for peace and stability.

- **Dynamics of Global Security:** Analyzing the interplay of geopolitical and economic factors underlying defense policies and military spending in various countries, focusing on comparative analysis.

- **Industrial Bases and Technological Infrastructure:** Studying the role of industrial bases and technological infrastructure in supporting innovation and maintaining a competitive position in defense capabilities.

- **Policy Making:** Assessing how defense innovation impacts national and international policy-making and exploring ways to optimize these policies to improve security while fostering technological advancement.

- **Feedback Loops of Defense Export:** Investigating how successful defense exports drive innovation within the defense sector.

These interests shape my current and future research projects. I apply advanced methodologies, including regression models and impulse response functions, to understand the complex interactions within these areas.
