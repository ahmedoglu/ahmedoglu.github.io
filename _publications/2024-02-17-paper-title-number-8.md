Nations shape their defense strategies through their socio-technical imaginaries. This journey involves the challenge of achieving strategic autonomy while navigating dependencies on major powers and allies (ie. NATO and the EU). This paper examines how Czechia deals with this challenge. Czechia implemented a structured policy-driven approach to defense innovation. This approach can be analyzed through a deep examination of historical experiences, security imperatives, and alliance structures. The case study of Czechiaâ€™s drone innovation is examined to understand the narratives before and after 2022. The findings suggest that socio-technical imaginaries actually shape defense innovation by linking national security to technological sovereignty. This explains how Czechia conceptualizes its military future and shows its approach to defense strategies which are derived from how the defense stakeholders see their security future. Czechia envisions a security future where integration into European defense frameworks assists its defense autonomy goal, balancing national capabilities with alliance commitments.
