The Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) framework has been an essential part of Europe’s strategy for collective defense and provides a platform where collaborative work by the EU member states for the development and enhancement of military capabilities is facilitated. Long-term efficacy will depend on full involvement by every country in PESCO, and actually I see that sentence is even more meaningful when we talk particularly about the smaller countries. Projects such as the European Patrol Corvette EPC with Greece and Portugal showcase the integration of these smaller countries within complex projects in defense. These nations provide distinctive geographic and operational advantages, including Portugal’s presence in the Atlantic and Greece’s expertise in naval operations, which are crucial for fortifying Europe’s maritime defense. Emphasizing their participation not only improves the projects under PESCO but also guarantees an equitable distribution of the benefits of innovation throughout the European Union.

Ireland’s involvement in PESCO is noticeable at a noteworthy moment of strategic significance for small countries vis-à-vis the assumption of collective security challenges; the protection of critical infrastructure, such as undersea cables, upon which global communications and trade depend, rises capably to certain high-consequence challenges. The participation shapes closer unity and solidarity within the EU and proves that the size of a country is not an indicator of the contribution one can make to collective security. Moreover, Ireland’s involvement points out the capability of smaller countries in providing added strength to Europe’s security framework.

The structure of PESCO offers a platform for collaboration, but actively prioritizing smaller nations ensures their unique strengths are fully utilized. Smaller states often have more specialized capabilities than their larger ones. Take for example Malta’s contribution to strategic oversight in the Mediterranean: this helps with the monitoring of migration and maritime security. Estonia’s excellence in cybersecurity reinforces the digital defenses of Europe. Emphasizing these contributions will make PESCO even more capable, hence further balancing out the resilience and agility of the defense ecosystem in response to all kinds of security challenges.

It is necessary to include small nations with the aim of balancing possible over-centralization in defense projects. Every time bigger states lead the projects, PESCO may be perceived by the small countries as an excluding force, weakening its cohesiveness. This may cause fragmented support and destroys the credibility of PESCO as a unifying force. Equitable participation gives smaller states a stake in the success of this framework and reinforces shared responsibility and trust between the member states. This is particularly important since Europe is exposed externally to challenges that can only be met completely through such a response.

Eventually, PESCO’s focus on including smaller countries strengthens the EU’s collective defense and showcases Europe’s ability to innovate through collaboration. The EU can design a defense that is inclusive and forward-looking by capitalizing on the geographical advantages, specialized skills, and perspectives of smaller nations. This approach not only grows Europe’s capacity to deal with emerging threats but also fosters a sense of unity and a common purpose for all member states. In reality, if PESCO is to really work, it must go beyond token inclusion and empower smaller nations to lead and shape its defense initiatives, ensuring that Europe remains secure and cohesive in an increasingly volatile global landscape.
