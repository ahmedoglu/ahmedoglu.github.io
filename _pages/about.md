I am Mümin Ahmedoğlu, studying for my Master's in **Management and Technology** at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). My academic interest lies at the junction of **Strategy, Policy, Management, and Innovation**, with a technological specialization in **Computer Engineering**. On that note, my studies have equipped me with a robust understanding of the **politics of innovation**, current issues related to **technology management**, and **public policy**.

My key areas of research interest lie at the intersection of **defense innovation**, **arms control**, **disarmament**, and how they relate more broadly to **global security and technology policy**. In particular, I focus on how changes in technologies influence the dynamics of **international security and policy development**. Finally, I am also interested in the **economic and political factors** that drive **innovation** in the **defense sector**, the role of the industrial base and technological infrastructure in fostering innovation, and how innovation links back into defense exports.

My current research projects include an **empirical comparative study** of the **defense policies** of Turkey and Germany, **re-purposing** **military UAVs for civilian uses**, and the global dynamics of defense spending. These projects use advanced regression models and impulse response functions applied to multi-country data to further advance the present understanding of defense innovation's economic, political, and technological drivers.

I mastered **Arabic**, **English**, and **Turkish**, and I am currently learning **German**, which helps me to enhance my ability to **collaborate** internationally. My goal is to be able soon to contribute to defense and security with cutting-edge research and, therefore, share it with the broader academic and policy-making communities.

Feel free to explore my work and reach out for possible collaborations or discussions on topics related to defense innovation and technology management.

Current Research Projects
======
- **Defense Innovation and Policy Dynamics**: In collaboration with [Professor Dr. Paul W. Thurner](https://www.gsi.uni-muenchen.de/personen/professoren/thurner/index.html) and [Dr. Oliver Pamp](https://www.en.gsi.uni-muenchen.de/people/academic/oliver_pamp/index.html) at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München (LMU), I am currently developing an empirical model that investigates the dynamics of defense innovation at both country and company levels. This project aims to conceptualize, measure, and understand the economic, political, and technological drivers of innovation in the defense sector, with particular focus on how these factors interact to influence global security policies.

- **From the Periphery to the Centre? Czech and Turkish Ambition in NATO’s Airspace Industry**: In collaboration with [Dr. Bohuslav Pernica](https://www.muni.cz/en/people/161932-bohuslav-pernica), this comparative study assesses the ambitions of Czechia and Turkey within NATO's airspace industry, particularly focusing on their respective military training jets—the L-39 NG and TAI Hürjet. The research explores how each country leverages its industrial base and government support to develop, produce, and export these advanced pilot training jets designed for the 4th–5th generation supersonic Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA). The study includes a detailed analysis of the involvement and strategic support by both governments in these projects, providing insights into how smaller NATO members can influence and integrate into the broader alliance's defense capabilities.

Research Interests
======
My research interests encompass a broad range of topics within the fields of innovation in defense, arms control, and disarmament, including:

- **Defense Innovation**: Investigating how technological advancements such as UAVs, AI, and cyber warfare reshape military capabilities and influence global security policies.
  
- **Economics of Defense Innovation**: Exploring the economic factors that drive technological advancements in the defense sector, including the funding, cost structures, and market dynamics that influence innovation and its adoption within military and defense frameworks.
  
- **Defense Export as a Driver of Innovation**: Examining how successful defense exports contribute to further innovation within the defense sector by creating feedback loops that stimulate R&D and the adoption of new technologies, ultimately enhancing national security and global competitiveness.
  
- **Arms Control**: Examining international treaties, policies, and mechanisms designed to regulate the proliferation and development of conventional and unconventional weapons, including nuclear, biological, chemical, and traditional arms, to enhance global security and stability.
  
- **Disarmament**: Exploring strategies and frameworks for the systematic reduction and abolition of armed forces and weapons, aiming to create conditions for peace and stability.
  
- **Dynamics of Global Security**: Analyzing the interplay of geopolitical and economic factors underlying defense policies and military spending in various countries, focusing on comparative analysis.
  
- **Industrial Bases and Technological Infrastructure**: Studying the role of industrial bases and technological infrastructure in supporting innovation and maintaining a competitive position in defense capabilities.
  
- **Policy Making**: Assessing how defense innovation impacts national and international policy-making and exploring ways to optimize these policies to improve security while fostering technological advancement.

These interests shape my current and future research projects. I apply advanced methodologies, including regression models and impulse response functions, to understand the complex interactions within these areas.
