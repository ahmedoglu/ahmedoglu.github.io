This article analyzes the complex dynamics of participation in The Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) projects by exploring the interplay of arms trade level, technolog- ical capacity, and economic factors among innovation and operational initiatives. It em- ploys logistic regression, network analysis, and clustering techniques to reveal the drivers of collaboration and the roles of participating nations. The results highlight that Arms Export is the most striking determinant for most project types, especially innovation projects, underscoring the crucial role of arms exports and granted patents in shaping participation. The negative and positive eﬀects of granted patents point to contextual priorities, showing positive associations within innovation projects but revealing negative impacts on operational projects. This divergence illustrates the diﬀering emphases on technological development versus preparedness and logistics. Economic indicators, such as GDP per capita and defense spending (% GDP), exhibit limited direct eﬀects, sug- gesting that defense-specific capabilities override general economic variables. Network analysis indicates a hierarchical structure, with leading actors such as France, Germany, and Italy spearheading joint projects, while less powerful countries remain underrepre- sented. Clustering analysis further reveals detailed participation patterns, highlighting the monopolization of technological leadership by a few countries and the greater in- clusiveness of operational partnerships. This paper emphasizes the need to synchronize national capacities with project aims to enhance inclusivity and promote resilience within the European defense framework.
