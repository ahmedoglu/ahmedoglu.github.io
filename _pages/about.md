I am Mümin Ahmedoğlu, a doctoral researcher at the University of Vienna’s Department of Business Decisions and Analytics and a graduate of the Master’s program in Management and Technology at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). My academic work lies at the intersection of defense procurement, institutional economics, and innovation policy, combining formal modeling with empirical analysis to study how European institutions coordinate complex, multi-country defense projects.

My current research focuses on the coordination and efficiency of defense procurement in the European Union, examining how industrial asymmetries, sovereignty constraints, and institutional mechanisms—such as the European Defence Fund (EDF) and PESCO—influence cooperation, innovation, and policy outcomes. More broadly, I am interested in the political economy of defense innovation, the industrial foundations of strategic autonomy, and the design of efficient policy mechanisms in security and technology domains.

Beyond my doctoral work, I have studied comparative defense policy, the civilian adaptation of military technologies (UAVs), and the global dynamics of defense spending and innovation. My approach integrates contract theory, econometric modeling, and data-driven analysis to bridge theoretical insights with policy relevance.

I am fluent in Arabic, English, and Turkish, and currently advancing my German, which supports my engagement in international and interdisciplinary research environments. My goal is to contribute to a more coherent understanding of how analytical and economic perspectives can improve defense cooperation and policy design in Europe.

Current Research Projects
======
- **Coordination Problems in EU Defense Procurement: A Common Agency and Contract Theory Analysis**: My doctoral research investigates how European Union member states coordinate defense procurement and spending within institutional frameworks such as the European Defence Fund (EDF) and PESCO. The project applies common agency and contract theory to examine how industrial asymmetries, sovereignty constraints, and divergent national interests shape efficiency, innovation, and policy outcomes in joint defense projects. Combining theoretical modeling with empirical analysis of EDF project data and case studies (e.g., Eurodrone), the research seeks to develop evidence-based insights for improving coordination and institutional design in European defense cooperation.

- **Synchronized Politics**: Time, Power, and Policy Coordination in the European Union [(SYNCPOL)](https://www.gsi.uni-muenchen.de/lehreinheiten/ls_ps_eu_integration/forschungamlehrstuhl/erc-grant/index.html): As a Graduate Research Assistant at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität Munich, I contribute to the ERC Advanced Grant project SYNCPOL: Synchronized Politics – Multiple Times and Political Power, led by [Prof. Klaus H. Goetz](https://www.gsi.uni-muenchen.de/personen/professoren/goetz/index.html). The project investigates how temporal structures—such as urgency, foresight, and sequencing—shape power dynamics and policy coordination across EU institutions. My role focuses on quantitatively modeling how time-related political language influences multi-level governance in the domains of migration and defense. This involves the semantic scaling of political speeches from the European Commission, Parliament, and Council using advanced NLP techniques, including fine-tuned Sentence-BERT models, dynamic embeddings, and PCA-based ideological mapping.

- **From the Periphery to the Centre? Czech and Turkish Ambition in NATO’s Airspace Industry**: In collaboration with [Dr. Bohuslav Pernica](https://www.muni.cz/en/people/161932-bohuslav-pernica), this comparative study assesses the ambitions of Czechia and Turkey within NATO's airspace industry, particularly focusing on their respective military training jets—the L-39 NG and TAI Hürjet. The research explores how each country leverages its industrial base and government support to develop, produce, and export these advanced pilot training jets designed for the 4th–5th generation supersonic Multi Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA). The study includes a detailed analysis of the involvement and strategic support by both governments in these projects, providing insights into how smaller NATO members can influence and integrate into the broader alliance's defense capabilities.



Completed Research Projects
======

- **EU Defense Discourse and Institutional Dynamics**: For my Master’s thesis at the Technical University of Munich (School of Management, Chair of Economics of Innovation, supervised by [Dr. David Angenendt](https://www.ep.mgt.tum.de/en/eoi/team/researchers/dr-david-angenendt/)), I conducted the first comprehensive quantitative study of European Union institutional discourse on defense cooperation and strategic autonomy from 2000 to 2024. Employing a multi-method approach that combined computational text analysis, panel data econometrics, and time-series methods, the project analyzed 6.41 million sentences from European Commission and European Parliament communications. Transformer-based models classified defense-related content with 98.4% accuracy, allowing the identification of four distinct discourse dimensions: defense emphasis, joint capability promotion, sovereignty-oriented framing, and threat justification.


Research Interests
======

My work sits at the intersection of defense procurement, innovation policy, and institutional design, with a focus on how Europe can coordinate complex, multi-country programs efficiently while still spurring innovation and safeguarding strategic information.

- **Defense Procurement & Multi-Goal Design**: How EU buyers balance three objectives in joint programs—security of military/strategic information, innovation performance, and economic growth/competitiveness—and how procurement instruments (PCP, PIS, Innovation Partnerships) can be structured to deliver on all three. 

- **Coordination under Asymmetry (EDF, PESCO)**: How industrial capability gaps between small and large member states and divergent budget logics (NATO 2%, EDA benchmarks) shape collaboration, burden sharing, and “spend more, spend better, spend European.” 

- **Common-Agency & Contract Theory for Joint Programs**: Applying common-agency and mechanism-design approaches to model multi-principal procurement (follow-on contracts, bundling vs. unbundling R&D/production, award criteria, negotiation vs. auction) and mitigate hold-up, lock-in, and foreclosure risks. 

- **Innovation Effects of Public Procurement**: When and how public procurement triggers firm-level innovation (vs. incremental diffusion), the role of buyer capabilities, and how design choices (technology-neutral vs. specific tenders) alter incentives. 

- **Strategic Investment & Industrial Base**: The political economy of sustained, multi-year defense investment and joint procurement as pillars of Europe’s defense-industrial capacity and strategic autonomy. 

**Methods:** Contract/game theory, multi-attribute optimization for procurement trade-offs, and empirical analysis (panel econometrics on EDF/PESCO data; comparative case studies such as Eurodrone), complemented by text-as-data on institutional discourse.
