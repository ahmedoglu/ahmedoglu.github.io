Work experience
======

- **Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität - Munich: Graduate Research Assistant (SYNCPOL Project)**
  - I work on the ERC-funded project SYNCPOL: Synchronized Politics, where I model how time-related political language—such as urgency, duration, and foresight—shapes EU policy coordination and power dynamics in migration and defense. My tasks include semantic scaling of political speeches across EU institutions using Python, Sentence-BERT, dynamic embeddings, and PCA-based ideological positioning.
 
- **Siemens - Munich: P&O Transformation Strategy Working Student**
  - I contribute to strategic people and organization transformation projects by developing data-driven concepts aligned with Siemens' People Strategy for Germany. I support data strategy implementation by analyzing people-related datasets, creating dashboards and reports, and promoting data-informed solutions for the future of work.

- **STM - Ankara: Associate Project Manager (Project Engineer)**
  - I managed technical projects related to tactical mini UAV systems and R&D projects for defense and military use, including KARGU, BOYGA, ALPAGU, and TOGAN.

 - **TUM Venture Labs - Munich: Technology Infrastructure Graduate Working Student**
    - I align technology infrastructure in Munich with startups' needs, automate and optimize the startup journey with TUM Venture Labs, and facilitate connections between startups and resources.


- **Siemens Advanta Solutions - Munich: Strategy, Digitalization & Sustainability Working Student**
  - I collaborated on sustainability-driven strategic initiatives and supporting regional digitalization projects.



- **TUM School of Management - Munich: IT Management & Enterprise Processes Working Student**
  - I was involved in IT process design and integration, process optimization, and agile project management.
    


- **Allianz SE - Munich: Group IT Strategy & Management Working Student**
  - I managed the Enterprise Architecture Repository and leading CIO communications and IT transformation initiatives.
