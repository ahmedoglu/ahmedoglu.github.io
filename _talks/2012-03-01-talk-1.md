This presentation explored the evolution of European Union defense discourse and institutional dynamics through a comprehensive analysis of political speeches from the European Commission and European Parliament over the period 2000-2024. Using a novel combination of computational text analysis and advanced econometric methods, I investigate how defense-related discourse responds to external security threats, institutional mechanisms, and domestic political pressures. The research employs a balanced panel dataset (N=50) covering 25 years across two institutions, analyzing four distinct dimensions of defense discourse: Defense Speech Share, Joint Capability Share, Sovereignty Share, and Threat Justification Share.

The presentation is part of the 28th International Conference on Economics and Security (ICES 2025).
