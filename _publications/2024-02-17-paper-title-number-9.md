The Czech Aero L-39NG and Turkish Hürjet represent two contrasting approaches to the development of military training aircraft, reflecting different national attitudes toward defense-industrial policy, procurement models, and global market positioning. The study examines the economic, historical, and geopolitical factors underlying the two programs, situating them within the context of Johan Galtung’s structural theories of integration and imperialism as well as contemporary defense economics literature. Utilizing a comparative case study method, the research evaluates determinative factors such as as government involvement, procurement autonomy, alliance integration, market competitiveness, and industrial scaling. The findings underscore that Czechia’s approach is one of niche specialization within NATO’s supply chain, leveraging legacy capabilities for export production, whereas Turkey’s holistic defense industrialization and strategic autonomy model relies on state-sponsored investment to challenge advanced Western suppliers. This examination makes important contributions to the literature on defense policy by demonstrating how mid-sized and smaller states can successfully manage the global arms market’s dynamics, striking a balance between integration and autonomy while developing viable aerospace industries. The research further offers policy suggestions to improve national defense R&D, promote cooperation within alliances, and minimize supply chain dependencies. Finally, the L-39NG and Hürjet cases embody the new roles of emerging defense producers amid a growing multipolar military-industrial structure.
