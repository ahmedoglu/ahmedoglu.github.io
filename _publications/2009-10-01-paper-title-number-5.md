This study examines the interaction between defense collaborations, military expen- ditures, and the defense industrial base in influencing economic growth in the EU. To achieve this, it employs a multi-method approach integrating Panel Vector Autoregres- sion (PV AR), Community Detection Algorithms (Louvain and Girvan-Newman methods), Weighted Network Centrality Measures (Degree, Betweenness, Eigenvector Centrality), and Dynamic Panel Models. By incorporating a network-based perspective, this study oï¬€ers a comprehensive analysis of how defense collaboration intensity and project typolo- gies contribute to economic outcomes.
