I am Mümin Ahmedoğlu, studying for my Master's in Management and Technology at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). My academic interest lies at the junction of Strategy, Policy, Management, and Innovation, with a technological specialization in Computer Engineering. On that note, my studies have equipped me with a robust understanding of the politics of innovation, current issues related to technology management, and public policy.

My key areas of research interest lie at the intersection of defense innovation, arms control, disarmament, and how they relate more broadly to global security and technology policy. In particular, I focus on how changes in technologies influence the dynamics of international security and policy development. Finally, I am also interested in the economic and political factors that drive innovation in the defense sector, the role of the industrial base and technological infrastructure in fostering innovation, and how innovation links back into defense exports.

My current research projects include an empirical comparative study of the defense policies of Turkey and Germany, re-purposing military UAVs for civilian uses, and the global dynamics of defense spending. These projects use advanced regression models and impulse response functions applied to multi-country data to further advance the present understanding of defense innovation's economic, political, and technological drivers.

I mastered Arabic, English, and Turkish, and I am currently learning German, which helps me to enhance my ability to collaborate internationally. My goal is to be able soon to contribute to defense and security with cutting-edge research and, therefore, share it with the broader academic and policy-making communities.

Feel free to explore my work and reach out for possible collaborations or discussions on topics related to defense innovation and technology management.

Research Interests
======
My research interests encompass a broad range of topics within the fields of innovation in defense, arms control, and disarmament, including:

**Defense Innovation:** Investigating how technological advancements such as UAVs, AI, and cyber warfare reshape military capabilities and influence global security policies.

**Arms Control:** Examining international treaties, policies, and mechanisms designed to regulate the proliferation and development of conventional and unconventional weapons, including nuclear, biological, chemical, and traditional arms, to enhance global security and stability.

**Disarmament:** Exploring strategies and frameworks for the systematic reduction and abolition of armed forces and weapons, aiming to create conditions for peace and stability.

**Dynamics of Global Security:** Analyzing the interplay of geopolitical and economic factors underlying defense policies and military spending in various countries, focusing on comparative analysis.

**Industrial Bases and Technological Infrastructure:** Studying the role of industrial bases and technological infrastructure in supporting innovation and maintaining a competitive position in defense capabilities.

**Policy Making:** Assessing how defense innovation impacts national and international policy-making and exploring ways to optimize these policies to improve security while fostering technological advancement.

**Feedback Loops of Defense Export:** Investigating how successful defense exports drive innovation within the defense sector.
These interests shape my current and future research projects. I apply advanced methodologies, including regression models and impulse response functions, to understand the complex interactions within these areas.

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
