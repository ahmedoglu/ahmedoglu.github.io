The Eurodrone project represents a major step toward strengthening the EU’s defense capabilities under PESCO (Permanent Structured Cooperation). However, its development is shaped—and at times constrained—by a complex web of regulations, strategic goals, and geopolitical considerations. This research explores how EU laws on arms exports, data protection, and AI governance impact Eurodrone’s progress, while also assessing its significance for European strategic autonomy in defense technology. Beyond legal constraints, the study delves into operational and political challenges, such as funding uncertainties, interoperability requirements, and coordination among EU member states. Using a policy analysis and case study approach, alongside comparisons with U.S. and NATO drone policies, this research identifies key roadblocks and potential solutions. The findings aim to inform policymakers on how to balance innovation, security, and regulation—ensuring that Eurodrone can fulfill its role in a more autonomous and capable European defense strategy.
