This talk explores how variations in arms trade dynamics, national technological capabilities, and economic strength influence the participation of EU member states in Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO). The study contributes to debates in defense economics and European security policy by empirically analyzing the drivers of differentiated integration in military cooperation. 

The presentation is part of the 28th International Conference on Economics and Security (ICES 2025).
