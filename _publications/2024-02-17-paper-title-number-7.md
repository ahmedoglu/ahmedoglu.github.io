This research investigates the regulatory dilemmas of the Eurodrone project within the context of Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) and the European Union's overall strategic autonomy strategy. Operating within the framework of techno-securitization theory and through the lens of the regulatory security state concept, this research looks into how EU defense policy, procurement, and export control systems influence the development, realization, and market viability of the Eurodrone. A comparison with Turkey's Bayraktar TB2 illustrates the inherent trade-offs between regulatory stringency and industrial responsiveness, showing how the European Union's strict legal frameworks impact cost-effectiveness, operational flexibility, and export sales potential. Based on a qualitative policy analysis of EU defense reports, procurement policies, and industrial policies, this study identifies significant obstacles to the attainment of technological sovereignty in Europe's UAV industry. The results highlight the requirement for regulatory changes to optimize defense collaboration, improve market access, and balance competitive strengths with strategic autonomy in the global defense sector.
