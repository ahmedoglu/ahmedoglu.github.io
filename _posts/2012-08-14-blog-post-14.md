From the 1980s and 1990s to the present day, much evolution has been noted in Türkiye’s defense industry. Looking back at the factors elaborated in the historical context, we can make comparisons that provide insight into Türkiye’s growth, strategic shifts, and challenges still facing its defense sector today.

I traced the evolution of Türkiye’s defense industry through a detailed paper in the book Arms Industry Limited by SIPRI. I focused on one of the chapters, which represented the status of Türkiye’s defense sector from 1982 to 1991. The insights obtained are for a country highly dependent on foreign arms imports and strategic alliances within NATO. When setting these findings against the current defense landscape of Türkiye, I was able to pick up the significant shifts in strategy and technology, along with the unsettled challenges. This analysis will give a bird’s-eye view of how Türkiye has moved from its dependencies to a much more assertive and independent defense posture, reflecting broader geopolitical ambitions in today’s multipolar world.

Geopolitical Context
1982-1991
The Cold War deeply marked, from a geopolitical point of view, the importance of Türkiye in the second half of the 20th century. Being a NATO member at the southeastern border of the alliance and the Soviet Union, Türkiye became the ally that the West could not do without: it transformed it, geographically, into a frontier state in the general East-West confrontation; that fact would decisively influence its policy of defense and the characteristics by which the militarization of Türkiye would be outlined.

Türkiye’s role as a bulwark against Soviet expansionism required it to be well armed. This involved massive arms imports, mainly from the United States and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization members. Such strategic necessity for a strong defense posture was further underpinned by Türkiye’s membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which provided security guarantees and military aid. This period discovered Türkiye’s dependence on foreign military equipment, yet it also lit the first moves to secure its arms industry, as manifested in the founding of companies like TAI.
The Gulf War in 1991 brought about a realization concerning the strategic value of Türkiye, which was worth more than it had during the Cold War days. Türkiye further solidified its position as the key regional player by providing bases and logistic support to coalition forces. Nonetheless, this also exposed Türkiye to the intricacies of the politics characterizing the Middle East, especially about Iraq and the broader Arab world. The war underlined the necessity for Türkiye to hold a modern and well-equipped military able to manage without any complications the regional instability and its internal security challenges, such as the ongoing Kurdish insurgency.
After the reform of the constitution, rogue states, such as Iran or Syria, could no longer see Türkiye as a pushover. Very much among the leading drivers of increased defense spending and focusing efforts toward developing military capabilities responsive not only to conventional threats but also asymmetric warfare for counter-insurgency operations at home and around a highly volatile region was the Kurdish insurgency, represented mainly by the PKK, at that time.
Now
The geopolitical environment of Türkiye remains complex today, but its defense strategy has undergone sea changes from the late-century ones. Türkiye is now moving in a multipolar world where the equations between allies and foes have blurred significantly, and its defense posture is in sync with that.

Even though Türkiye remains a member of NATO, its defense policy has become independent and assertive. The clear-cut alliances of the Cold War have yielded to a more fluid geopolitical landscape in which Türkiye tries to juggle its commitments to NATO with national interests. This ranges from the purchase by Türkiye of the Russian S-400 missile defense system, which has caused immense friction between the USA and other members of NATO. This move epitomizes Türkiye’s inherent will to exercise sovereignty in defense procurement, even at the cost of straining traditional alliances.
The Turkish military operations in Syria and Iraq, mainly targeting Kurdish forces, underscore the country’s increasingly proactive policy in regional security. Unlike in the 1980s and 1990s, when Türkiye was more reactive to external threats, today, it is actively shaping the security landscape in its neighborhood. In Syria, it provides support to rebel forces against the Assad regime and Kurdish groups, such as the YPG, which is viewed to be an extension of the PKK.
The other front, interestingly, where Türkiye’s hardline stance has been evidenced, is in its conflicts with Greece, but in Cyprus and over sea borders and energy exploration rights in the Eastern Mediterranean. These tensions have pitched Türkiye into open conflict with EU members, creating problems for its relations within NATO and with the wider European community. This reflects a broader trend of Türkiye’s quest for an independent, sometimes quite challenging, foreign policy that favors national interests over traditional alliance structures.
Türkiye’s relationship with global powers — the US, Russia, and the EU — has become more complex and transactional. Maintaining membership in NATO, Türkiye has developed relations with Russia, evidenced by its cooperation on defense and energy projects such as the TurkStream pipeline. At the same time, Türkiye’s EU accession process has halted, and Ankara is establishing alternative alliances and regional partnerships. Under this multipolar approach, Türkiye can adapt to an increasingly unpredictable global environment but also take on new risks of isolation or miscalculation in attempting to balance competing interests.
Military Expenditure and Arms Imports
1982–1991
The military expenditure of the Republic of Türkiye during the latter half of the twentieth century was in consonance with an upward graph, expressive of strategic priorities and geopolitical concerns that the country felt then. In effect, Türkiye’s budgetary allocations for defense increased much more rapidly than any of its NATO allies. These increases were maintained high due to external threats and internal security concerns. In this period, Türkiye had a high dependence rate on foreign arms imports in its attempts at modernizing military forces. It had a downside, though, and Türkiye was well aware of its strategic vulnerability.

In this respect, during the 1980s and 1990s, the bulk of the military modernization in Türkiye depended very much on imports of the latest technology concerning weaponry and advanced systems from NATO allies. Much of it was the need to increase the military capabilities of Türkiye fast, not just to address the Cold War era threats but also regional instabilities, such as the Kurdish insurgency. This dependence, therefore, implied that while it was confident that the best applications of technological advancement in Türkiye’s defense were specific, defense policy itself was significantly bound to the geopolitical interests and decisions of the suppliers. The embargo on US arms that followed the 1974 intervention in Cyprus served as a lesson on the dangers of such dependence and provided much of the impetus for a Turkish reorientation in long-term defense strategy.
The realization was done in the early 1980s, thus aimed at modernizing its arms industry. According to strategic priorities, the idea behind this was to break away from foreign arms imports and be self-sufficient for defense. This was when leading defense companies such as ASELSAN or TAI were established to develop the technological and industrial base necessary for autonomous production.
Now
Türkiye’s defense industry is now entirely different and incomparable to what it was little more than a decade ago. It has become one of Türkiye’s highly dynamic and fast-growing sectors and on the global scene. The transformation from being one of the largest importers of foreign weaponry in the late 1990s to a more self-dependent and diversified defense industrial base has been strategic foresight and national ambition.

Türkiye today is one of the top defense spenders worldwide, and the Turkish defense industry is not just an importer but has acquired the status of an emerging exporter of military technology. Companies such as ASELSAN, TAI, ASFAT, MKE, and Roketsan, among others, have become independent leaders in manufacturing advanced systems, including drones, missiles, armored vehicles, and electronic warfare systems. The Bayraktar TB2 UAV, on the other hand, has received international recognition, and this UAV is being exported even to countries like Ukraine and Qatar. This ended from being in the yesteryears when Türkiye used to excessively depend on importations of such technologies.
The current defense policy of Türkiye is obsessed with this and lays heavy emphasis on making it more prominent, with greater self-sufficiency that leads to considerable investments in research and development (R&D) and expansion of domestic production capabilities. The success of relying on indigenous capabilities is also evidenced by Türkiye’s ability to produce much military equipment at home, negating the situation for imports. This will enhance Türkiye’s strategic autonomy and position it as an emerging player in the world arms market.
Despite the above, Türkiye needs help with some technologies, especially regarding the high-tech development of jet engines, long-range missile systems, and avionics, which still have been highly complex and resource-intensive for a state to quickly develop independently. Türkiye continues, therefore, to establish numerous partnerships and other collaborations that have the perspective to bridge such gaps, both within its domestic front and in regional and international dimensions. It is in domains like the Long-Range Air and Missile Defense System or the national fighter jet program, TF-X, in which Türkiye strives to offset these challenges — all with different degrees of success — while it continues being dependent precisely on foreign partnerships.
The growth in the Turkish defense industry has also been reflected in its ever-increasing global presence within the global arms export market. Military equipment has seen vast exports to various countries, contributing to the country’s economy and building up its geopolitical power. Export growth was internationally excellent in the 1980s and 1990s for a primarily importer country. This sends out the message that the country is not only proud but also helps reinforce Türkiye’s strategic autonomy as there is much less dependence on third countries to take care of defense needs.
Defense Industry Modernization
1982–1991
Modernization program was the hitherto watershed regarding Türkiye’s military ambitions. Back then, the Turkish administration felt the necessity to reduce dependence on foreign arms imports, particularly against the backdrop of the intervention in Cyprus in 1974, which saw an arms embargo slapped by the United States. That marked the period when Türkiye began her effort to establish a more self-sufficient defense industry, though in a highly bumpy way.

Forming Turkish Aerospace Industries in 1984 to produce F-16 fighter jets under a US licensing agreement was one such success story. However, this highlighted the reliance on Türkiye’s defense industry in that era. In general, most of the production process for F-16s relied on foreign technology, know-how, and components; large portions of the aircraft were still being manufactured abroad. While such joint ventures brought in ‘experience and technology’ to help Türkiye, they at the same time underlined the country’s dependence on external support as its most vital defense capability. Ambitious at the outset, the program was inherently constrained by Türkiye’s fledgling industrial base and the many complexities high-tech defense manufacturing involves.
During the 1980s and 1990s, Türkiye’s defense modernization was marked by a high dependency on foreign expertise and technology transfer. Joint ventures with Western companies were the only route to modernize Türkiye’s military; they also imposed severe limitations on the possibility of Türkiye innovating or developing independent defense technologies simultaneously. This dependency was witnessed in areas such as avionics, jet engines, and advanced missile systems, where Türkiye’s domestic capabilities had not been well developed.
Now
The current outlook of the Turkish defense sector differs significantly from the one it held back in the past. Over the last two decades, Türkiye has made immense progress toward becoming self-sufficient in defense production and an upcoming power on the global arms market scene.

The critical shift that Türkiye is affecting with its defense modernization is moving from the assembly of foreign-designed systems to the realization of indigenous platforms. This trend is exemplified in several high-profile projects such as:
The Altay tank which is the first indigenous tank representing Türkiye’s ambitions to create a high-tech armored vehicle. Although the project has suffered from constant delays, particularly with acquiring an indigenous power pack, it shows that Türkiye will remain independent of foreign suppliers.
In very few instances, one procurement, that of the Bayraktar TB-2 drone, comes to encapsulate success in defense innovation. Success can be because a Turkish company named Baykar made it. Turkish forces already use TB2 across a range of conflict zones, and it has already been exported to several countries.
Currently under construction, TCG Anadolu will be the first amphibious assault ship of any type in service with Türkiye — a serious step up in Turkish naval capability. It will be used as a helicopter carrier and a base for UAVs, further underlining its growing maritime ambitions.
Türkiye has similarly advanced in the aerospace sector, though it still needs to be developed. Some include:
The TF-X program represents the most ambitious project in Türkiye’s defense modernization drive. The TF-X is being developed to be a fifth-generation fighter jet and to minimize Türkiye’s dependency on foreign aircraft, primarily in light of the latest taut relations with the United States over the F-35 program. However, the TF-X project has been delayed because domestic development with advanced avionics, stealth features, and jet engines is quite complex. Despite all the odds, the program underlines Türkiye’s determination to be a significant player in the global aerospace industry. —
Türkiye’s ambitions exceed traditional defense systems and reach out for space and satellite technologies. Projects like the Göktürk Satellite Series underscore Türkiye’s effort to advance reconnaissance and communication capabilities. However, All this is in its infancy and points towards a strategic game plan to win space for Türkiye in the long run.
Despite all this progress, some technological gaps are still facing the Turkish defense industry. Türkiye still relies on others, primarily in terms of advanced jet engines, long-range missile systems, and electronic warfare capabilities. To overcome these shortcomings, Türkiye has entered into cooperative arrangements with South Korea and Pakistan and with Western firms — now under much tighter conditions that would guarantee technology transfers and domestic production.
Strategic Autonomy and Foreign Relations
1982–1991
In the late 20th century, Turkish defense policy was rigidly aligned with its alliances with NATO and the Western Bloc, and above all, with the United States. Being a front-line state in the Cold War, the strategic value of Türkiye could not be disputed, and most of its defense requirements were met through military aid and arms imports from NATO allies. Specific risks and limitations were involved in this alignment, and these became increasingly obvious with time.

The extended support from NATO and US military support greatly enhanced the security advantages for Türkiye, although the defense policy of the country was, in some measure, vulnerable to the political intentions of its allies. This dependence, therefore, was problematic when geopolitical frictions arose, just as with the Cyprus Crisis in 1974. Indeed, after Türkiye used American-supplied weapons in the course of the intervention in Cyprus, the US imposed an arms embargo on Türkiye, underlining its condemnation. Such an event highlighted the requirement of greater strategic autonomy for Türkiye. It led to a complete review of its defense strategy, resulting in initial attempts to develop a domestic arms industry.
The 1980s and 1990s registered a growing awareness in Türkiye of the vulnerabilities emerging from dependence on external sources for critical military enablers. Political strings invariably attached to foreign military aid and arms sales, penalizing Türkiye’s strategic latitude of choice. An important illustration of this was the Cyprus embargo, which briefly chafed Türkiye’s military capabilities and sensitized it to the hazards of over-dependence on any foreign source.
Off these challenges, Türkiye began to initiate ways of decreasing its reliance on foreign arms and increasing strategic autonomy. It encapsulates the modernization of its defense industry, efforts to diversify sources for military technology, and other such initiatives. Though these efforts were nascent in the 1980s and 1990s, they laid the groundwork for Türkiye’s future defense policy that increasingly relies on self-production at home and creating various defense partners.
Now
In contemporary times, Türkiye’s approach towards strategic autonomy has witnessed a sea change. Today, it aims at an independent and assertive defense policy, often deviating from the traditional alignment with NATO and the US — a trend mirroring a broader turn in its foreign relations and defense strategy.

Türkiye’s decision to buy the Russian S-400 missile defense system was oriented towards furthering strategic autonomy. Despite stringent opposition from both NATO and the US, Türkiye chose to pursue its national security interest rather than indulge in alliance politics. While the S-400 deal was met with sanctions under the US Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), it also resulted in the ejection of Türkiye from the F-35 fighter jet program. This decision reflects Türkiye’s willingness to pay the political costs of the friction to define defense objectives that reduce dependency on Western military technology.
The purchase of the S-400 is just one out of a series of deals that form a broader diversification strategy of defense partnerships beyond NATO. Türkiye has telegraphed an interest in maintaining a much more balanced, diversified foreign policy through its relationship with Russia. This diversification has equally applied to other defense relationships, including growing military cooperation with Pakistan, South Korea, and Qatar. As will be argued, this approach should allow Türkiye to mitigate the risks stemming from overreliance on any one ally or supplier and, therefore, have more strategic freedom in a multipolar world that has become infinitely more unpredictable and chaotic.
In parallel with this diversification of the security partnership, the efforts for the domestic security defense industry have been established very firmly. Domestic military technology development, such as the Bayraktar TB2 drone and the Altay main battle tank, demonstrates a reliance reduction policy for Türkiye’s agenda. By developing domestic production capabilities, Türkiye increases strategic autonomy while, at the same time, becoming one of the major players in the arms market. Such a transition from dependence to self-reliance is essential to Türkiye’s larger strategy to secure its national interests in a world growingly uncertain.
If Türkiye’s quest for strategic autonomy has made it more formidable from the defense perspective, it also puts the same stakeholders under geopolitical repercussions. Several issues, from the S-400 purchase to military operations in Syria, have soured relations with old allies like the US. Moreover, the assertiveness of Türkiye in the Eastern Mediterranean has also complicated EU relations because of its maritime disputes with Greece and Cyprus. Developments reflect the tension between Türkiye’s aspiration for independence and the reality of long-standing alliances.
The current Turkish defense and foreign policy have been characterized by a delicate balancing act. On one side, Türkiye is integrated within NATO, remains involved in the alliance’s activities, and contributes to the alliance’s missions. On the other side, it seeks to have an independent role in the world arena, being the author of policies that sometimes counter the interests of its traditional allies. This will be a tricky balancing act: Türkiye must juggle the demands of its NATO commitments with safeguarding its sovereignty and building partnerships, especially with non-NATO countries such as Russia.
Economic Impact and Internal Challenges
1982–1991
At the turn of the second half of the twentieth century, Türkiye’s defense modernization program was not limited to strategic and security concerns; it also held great economic aspirations. The development of the defense industry within the Turkish government’s framework was a way to fulfill broader financial goals, targeted toward more industrialization, reduced unemployment, and an enriched technological base that the country needed. However, the economic impact of this modernization was complex and, at times, mixed, underlining the opportunities and challenges involved in the priority given to defense spending.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Türkiye worked hard to use its defense modernization program as a catalyst for broader industrial and technological development. The primary defense companies, such as ASELSAN and TAI, were established to create highly skilled jobs, stimulate technological innovation, and reduce import dependency. This was part of Türkiye’s broader economic strategy for developing a more self-reliant industrial base to sustain civilian and military needs.
While the industries related to defense undoubtedly contributed towards industrial growth and technological developments, the prices to be paid for these trade-offs were very high. Huge allocations for the modernization programs required severe cuts in social spending and other vital sectors of the Defense Budget. Given the tremendous amount necessary to undertake modernization, tension exists between the need to enhance national security and pressing issues at home, such as education, health, and infrastructure development. The opponents of such high expenditure on defense argued that the resources could have been better utilized towards improving living standards and bridging economic disparities.
The economic viability of the Turkish defense spending during this period came under criticism. Finishing the defense budget through foreign loans and military aid made one question the long-term sustainability of such high expenditure levels. The economic benefits from defense spending also became regionally biased and concentrated in certain areas, mainly within the more developed regions in Türkiye.
Now
The contribution of the defense industry to Türkiye’s economy remains high to this day, but the challenges and trade-offs within the complex, dynamic economic environment are more apparent.

The country’s defense industry has been remarkable for decades, pegged to enormous contributions toward technological advancement and export revenues. Companies like ASELSAN, Roketsan, and Baykar developed state-of-the-art technologies that increased Türkiye’s military strength and placed it among the key actors in the international arms market. Turkish-made drones, missiles, and other defense equipment began to be exported to countries worldwide, bringing much-needed foreign currency and boosting national pride.
An implication of the growth in the defense industry, however, is increased competition for resources with other vital sectors. Periods of instability in the Turkish economy, characterized by high inflation, currency devaluation, and budgetary deficits, further raise questions over the logic of devoting considerable resources to defense spending. Critics argue that these funds could otherwise have been utilized to fight economic problems, from unemployment and poverty to underfinanced public services. This tension between defense spending and social investment increased to a critical debating point as economic pressures continued augmenting.
There is growing concern about the effect of the emphasis given to defense spending on the overall social welfare. Although the defense industry provides employment opportunities and incentivizes technological innovation, it certainly caters to no other immediate needs for the greater populace. When the government spends its money on the military, less is invested in different sectors such as health, education, and social services. Over time, this will negatively affect the quality of life in Türkiye and make the potential for social unrest even more significant in a country with such vast economic disparities.
Reconciling national security with economic stabilization and social welfare is indeed the challenge for Türkiye today. The strategic ambitions put an inordinate burden on developing a strong defense industry. That, however, brings the risks of economic instability, especially in times of financial crisis. Therein lies the criticality of the ability of a government to maintain a delicate balance in deciding Türkiye’s future economic and social trajectory.
More than that, the defense industry in Türkiye has exposed itself to global markets and related pressures. Building exports, the industry would be competing with well-established defense exporters. Hence, it becomes difficult to establish a delicate equilibrium among the complex international regulations and considerations of geopolitics. Further, reliance on defense exports leaves Türkiye vulnerable to changes in global demand and the possible introduction of sanctions or restrictions by critical markets. This growth by the defense industry at the domestic level has to contend with an economy mired in a slew of serious challenges, including high public debt and limited fiscal space.
Technological Interdependence and Innovation
1982–1991
In the late 20th century, Türkiye’s defense industry’s modernization was visibly marked by a high degree of dependence on foreign technology. The trend was more visible in leading-edge, high-tech fields — typically represented by aeronautics, electronics, and advanced weapon systems — where Türkiye couldn’t produce such technologies domestically.

Türkiye started many joint ventures and licensing agreements with foreign firms to bridge the technology gap, especially from the USA and Western Europe. This made it possible for Türkiye to assemble and produce defense equipment under license — for instance, F-16 fighter jets through the TAI and electronic systems through companies such as ASELSAN. While these cooperation projects supplied Türkiye with the needed access to advanced technologies, they also underlined the limitations of the current state of Türkiye’s domestic industrial base. Critical components and know-how often remained controlled by foreign partners, conducting its ability to innovate independently.
This heavy dependency on foreign technology was viewed as a strategic vulnerability. The constraints on autonomy would eventually make themselves felt at one of the points where adverse political or economic circumstances strained the relationship with supplier countries. The US arms embargo that resulted from Türkiye’s 1974 intervention in Cyprus is a good example. Türkiye’s inability to produce several key defense technologies domestically made any potential loss of access to foreign supplies a significant liability to maintaining an adequate state of military readiness.
Despite the abovementioned problems, the 1980s and 1990s sowed the seeds for the present efforts in Türkiye to indigenously build up technological capabilities. The setting up of domestic companies in the defense and related research organizations to wean away from dependency: Much focus was on incremental enhancements and the gradual bolstering of Indigenous industrial infrastructure. Türkiye has heavily bridged the technology gap, notably in some defense areas. However, achieving technological self-sufficiency in fully developing advanced systems is still challenging.
Now
In the last two decades, Türkiye has very impressively developed defense technologies of its own. State-led R&D across the country has helped develop various indigenous systems once held by outside countries. Some of these are :

With Bayraktar TB2, Türkiye has significantly succeeded in developing and deploying drones. The operation conducted several times in different fields had been a sign that Türkiye was on the right track to produce advanced unmanned systems that would attract attention in the global market. This capability not only boosted Turkish military autonomy but also defense exports.
Türkiye has succeeded in establishing its naval systems, such as the MILGEM-Class Corvettes and advanced electronic warfare systems, which ASELSAN mainly makes. These are all indicators that Türkiye is developing its capacities in significant domains of defense technologies and one day might become capable of producing complex systems inside the country.
Despite this, Türkiye has found discrepancies concerning several high-technology defense systems. Ideally, the following fall under the advanced fighter jets, long-range missile systems, and complex radar technology it produces. Example:
The TF-X is Türkiye’s most significant indigenous fighter jet program. However, the program is not all unicorns and rainbows, as it has been plagued by delays and many technical challenges, especially in developing engines and avionics. Türkiye has been trying to partner with other countries, the United Kingdom and South Korea among them, on the program, but in general, such projects need foreign expertise in such core areas; the dependency is an ongoing problem.
Long-range missile systems and radar technology developed to the most exacting standards remain one of the most daunting challenges in modern warfare. While efforts toward developing these technologies indigenously are underway in Türkiye, it is frequently found that many projects require foreign components or know-how to reach completion.
Türkiye’s current defense strategy is trying to balance the two edges: innovation and how it manages its dependencies. On the one hand, by making colossal ammunition regarding R&D to build local capacities and reduce dependency upon foreign suppliers, one has to accept that advanced technologies will take time to develop independence. This is a tension at the heart of Türkiye’s defense modernization effort, between the desires of being self-sufficient and being a dependency.
Türkiye’s growing role as a defense exporter has further complicated this dynamic. For example, apart from bringing national honor and economic advantages, the success of Turkish defense products on the world market in terms of drones and armored vehicles has also exposed Türkiye to the pressures and demands of the global defense market. Competing internationally requires Türkiye to innovate and develop state-of-the-art technologies, most often obtained through partnerships with foreign partners. This interaction with the worldwide market can drive technological advancement and perpetuate specific dependencies since international standards and competition demand perpetual access to state-of-the-art technologies.
Huge strategic implications are associated with Türkiye’s technological dependencies. The ability to produce and sustain advanced defense systems independently will be crucial for Türkiye in pursuing an assertion of its autonomy on the global stage. Yet the ongoing dependencies in some critical key areas, including with the US and Israel, require that Türkiye handle its relationships with care — balancing its needs for foreign partnerships with the aim of greater self-sufficiency.
Summary & Key Findings
The Turkish defense industry has transformed remarkably from the 1980s until now, reflecting broader tectonic shifts in geopolitical strategy, economic priorities, and technological ambitions. That said, it is a torchbearer of Türkiye’s strategic will toward greater self-reliance and autonomy on the world stage. This journey is far from over, and several long-standing enduring challenges continue to shape and influence the trajectory of its defense policy into the future.

1. Accomplishments in Self-Reliance and Technological Development

1980s-1990s:

In 1980, the defense industry in Türkiye was highly technology-dependent on imported arms and foreign help. The defense modernization phase that Türkiye had been following in the ’80s had a more excellent pinch, with some types of joint ventures and licensing agreements. Although it served the primary purpose of technology refresher, Türkiye’s innovation ability was scarce. This made it vulnerable to external pressures and political conditions through which the critical defense technologies have their foreign supplier, as seen in the US arms embargo of 1974 due to the Cyprus interference and invasion. Developing an independent defense industry was recognized as a necessity; nevertheless, the advancement of the country’s industrial and technological base is still at its junior level.

Present:

Today, Türkiye has been significantly leaning towards lesser dependence on foreign arms, thanks to fast-growing indigenous defense companies such as ASELSAN, TAI, and Roketsan and the development of major military technologies like the Bayraktar TB2 drone and MILGEM-class corvettes. Using foreign design to develop in-house technologies is a critical change in Türkiye’s defense strategy. Contrary to these developments, high-tech areas, such as fighter jet development and missile technology, remain dependent on foreign expertise and components.

2. Strategic Autonomy and Geopolitical Ambitions

1980s-1990s:

For the most part, defense policy in Türkiye turned out to be very close to that which NATO, particularly the United States, was to draw. A very close relationship with NATO and the West also meant that Türkiye was somewhat at risk, for, based on political expediencies and the strategic interests of the Western world, based on the same, Turkish defense was at the mercy of the same powers. The Cyprus embargo taught Türkiye this very lesson, and since then, it has been seeking an ever-growing measure of strategic independence to minimize its dependence on outside military help.

Present:

Turkish defense policy in the contemporary world is highly assertive and independent. This particular feature, in the face of very stiff opposition from NATO and the US, to buy the Russian missile defense system S-400, typifies Türkiye’s willingness to put its national security interests above the politics of alliances. Such a move has offended relations with old allies while emphasizing the resolve with which Türkiye seeks to diversify her defense partnerships and minimize dependency on any one power. The growing independence of Türkiye’s foreign policy and defense industry represents Türkiye’s giant geopolitical ambitions to be a significant regional and world power. However, this assertiveness has brought particular challenges — more so in cases where complicated international relations are involved or in facing the consequences of breaking away from long-cherished traditional alliances.

3. Balancing Economic Priorities and Defense Spending

The socio-economic effects of Türkiye’s defense modernization in the 1980s and 1990s were mixed. As much as the defense industry contributed to industrialization and technological acquisition, the issue of the sustainability of high defense spending and the consequent social welfare was also raised. The tension between the need to enhance national security and the imperatives to address domestic economic issues characterized much of this period. Economic burdens of high defense lodges even now. The defense industry has become a critical source of technological innovation, and it generates foreign currency through export revenue, which contributes to raising economic growth in Türkiye. However, a colossal resource allocation to defense during economic stress would question alternative investment opportunities, such as in the education and health sectors and infrastructure. The ability of the government to balance these competing priorities is thus crucial to guarantee long-term economic stability and social cohesion. The ongoing debate on the appropriate level of defense spending further illustrates the need to balance developing a solid defense industry while grappling with other broader economic challenges.

4. Ongoing Challenges and Future Prospects

Indeed, while progress has been made in the evolution of indigenous defense technologies, Türkiye’s journey towards being fully self-reliant is still a work in progress. The country has continued to face challenges in multiple sectors that require high technology and significant research and development investments. A good example is the indigenous TF-X fighter jet, which faces time delays due to technological challenges, particularly in engine manufacturing and avionics. Such problems, more than anything else, show that existing technical capabilities in Türkiye are held back by the nation being unliberated from foreign partnerships that prevent the country from attaining its desired defense posture.

The evolution in defense by Türkiye also depicts the broader dynamics of modern military-industrial development in an age of shifting global power structures. As Türkiye stands poised on the road to assert its influence as a country on the move, it must walk cautiously in this world characterized by multipolarity with tough rivalry and crossing interests. Engaging non-NATO partners, especially Russia, to pursue its strategic goals exemplifies Türkiye’s problem relating traditional alliances to pursuing greater autonomy.

Conslusion
The transformation of the Turkish defense industry from the 1980s to the present is a very expressive story behind this tremendous effort to become self-reliant, develop technology, be strategic, and gain global status. Türkiye’s defense strategy is in the very front row of avant-garde beads of sovereignty, independence, and self-sufficiency in strategy, aligning with broader regional and global ambitions. On the other hand, its historical dependencies and the relentless search for vital technologies suggest that Türkiye is far from achieving complete defense self-sufficiency.

Türkiye will continue its way only if it can solve the yet-to-be-faced technological problems, balance economic interests with defense requirements, and adequately evaluate the intricate net of international relations. The defense of the industry will stand as one of the critical leverages that form part of the general policy for winning and securing the interests of Türkiye on a national level, ensuring the realization of a far more competitive global move that will define the way Türkiye acts in the worldwide defense industry and, at last, but surely not the least, sits as a rising power in the 21st century.
